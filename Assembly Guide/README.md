# Assembly Guide

We present a [technical report](https://github.com/OpenBionics/Prosthetic-Hands/blob/3dPrinted/Assembly%20Guide/tex/OpenBionics_ProstheticHandsGuide2015.pdf), intended to serve as a step by step tutorial for the replication of the prosthetic hands. The guide contains illustrated instructions, carrying the user over all assembly steps and providing practical advice on any details that
require attention.

Figure 1. Tools required to build all hand components.

Illustrations of all required parts, components, tools and materials (see Fig.1) are included, while comprehensive Parts Reference tables are provided (see for example a table containing all palm parts in Table 1).

Table 1. The parts required to asseble the palm.

Each assembly step is preceeded by a relevant parts list table for convenience. For example Fig. 2 contains images of all the palm parts.

Figure 2. Parts required to build the palm.

The assembly is divided into two main sections: 1) Fingers Assembly and 2) Hand assembly, with the latter containing instructions on how to build and attach all the hand components on the palm.

## Hand Design

Following the design of the OpenBionics robotic hands [1], the Prosthetic hand [2] was designed to be affordable, lightweight and intrinsically-compliant. Its design is structurally and kinematically anthropomorphic. In particular, its sizing is parametrically determined by hand anthropometry studies [3], allowing for personalization and adjustment to the needs of each individual. Moreover, its kinematic model is derived by optimizing an index of anthropomorphism [4]. Finally, the prosthetic hand bears a novel differential mechanism based on the whiffletree mechanism [5] that allows the user to execute various grasping postures with a single actuator. Switching between the different postures or gestures is easy and intuitive. Simple locking buttons can independently block the motion of each finger. The proposed hands can be easily fabricated using low-cost, off-the-shelf materials and rapid prototyping techniques (e.g., 3D printing).
