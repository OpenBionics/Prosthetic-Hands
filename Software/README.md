# Arduino Firmware

In order to evaluate the capabilities of our prosthetic hand, we developed a simple firmware for Arduino using this [library](http://robottini.altervista.org/dongbu-herkulex-arduino-library-2) for Herkulex DRS-0201. 


We modified the library in order to control the motor with an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) Micro Pro.


# Next Steps

We plan on controlling our prosthetic hands with different interfaces, such as [these](https://github.com/OpenBionics/Robot-Hands/tree/master/CAD/Interfaces) or EMG sensors.
